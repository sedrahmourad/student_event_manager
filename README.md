üìö Student Event Manager API
üåü Project Overview
The Student Event Manager is a web application designed to help university students easily discover and register for academic and interest-based events relevant to their major. The platform ensures students don't miss out on valuable opportunities that align with their career goals and passions.


This repository contains the backend API built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Python (3.11+) and Django (5.x)

API Framework: Django REST Framework (DRF)

Database: SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production)

Authentication: Token-based Authentication (DRF's authtoken)

‚ú® Key Features
The API supports a role-based system differentiating between Students and Organizers.

1. User Management & Authentication 


Role-Based Registration: Supports sign-up for both Students (requires major) and Organizers (requires organization_name).




Login/Logout: Authenticates users and issues secure tokens.


Profile Management: Users can view and update their profile details.


2. Event Management (CRUD) 


Event Listing: Anyone can view the list of events.



Filtering: Events can be filtered by category (major) and date.


Organizer Panel: Organizers can create, update, and delete their own events.





Social Integration (Future): Events support Likes and Comments for community engagement.

3. Event Registration (Student Only) 


Registration: Students can register for an event using the event ID.



Dashboard View: Students can view a list of all their registered events.


Cancellation: Students can cancel their registration.
